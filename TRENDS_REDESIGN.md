# Trends Page Redesign Requirements

## Core Philosophy: "Click, Click, Done"
- AI works as silent orchestrator
- Minimal user input required
- AI learns from user actions automatically

## Key Features:

1. **Competitor Tracking (AI Training Only)**
   - Add competitors → AI automatically learns from their posts
   - No separate "train AI" button - it happens automatically
   - Click competitor → See posts → AI learns in background

2. **Location-Based Content**
   - User enters target location first
   - THEN trending content and memes appear
   - Content filtered by location

3. **Select & Edit Any Content**
   - Click any trending post/image/meme
   - Edit it → Create your own version
   - AI learns from what you edit

4. **AI Preferences (Simple Filters)**
   - Tone: Professional/Casual/Sassy/Hinglish
   - Length: Short/Medium/Long
   - Include hashtags/emojis
   - AI uses these automatically

5. **Usage Limits**
   - Daily/Monthly AI usage tracking
   - Visible at top of page

6. **Grok Integration**
   - For Hinglish and sassy posts
   - Automatic when tone selected

## UI Flow:
1. Enter location → See trends
2. Add competitor → AI learns automatically
3. Click content → Edit → AI learns your style
4. Set preferences → AI uses them automatically
5. Done. AI handles the rest.
